## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### Complex Algorithms Implemented

**1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient**
```typescript
// Stock comparison correlation matrix
const calculateCorrelation = (prices1, prices2) => {
  // Statistical correlation calculation
  // Returns -1 to 1 correlation strength
}
```

**2. Calendar Date Arithmetic**
```typescript
// Economic calendar 42-day grid
const getDaysInMonth = (date) => {
  // Generates 6 weeks (42 days)
  // Includes previous/next month days
  // Handles edge cases
}
```

**3. Countdown Timer Logic**
```typescript
// Human-readable time formatting
const calculateCountdown = (eventDate, eventTime) => {
  // Returns "5d 12h", "3h 45m", or "25m"
  // Handles past events
  // Updates in real-time
}
```

**4. Performance Color Gradient**
```typescript
// 8-level color mapping
const getPerformanceColor = (performance) => {
  // Maps performance to 8 color levels
  // Smooth gradient from red to green
  // Dynamic text color for contrast
}
```

**5. Technical Indicators**
```typescript
// Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI calculations
// Moving averages (SMA, EMA)
