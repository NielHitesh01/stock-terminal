# 🚀 UPDATE: Automatic Panel Resizing & Fullscreen Mode

**Release Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0.1  
**Type**: User Experience Enhancement

---

## 🎉 What's New

### 1. ⚡ Automatic Panel Resizing

**Problem Fixed:**
Previously, when you resized your browser window, the 4-panel grid didn't adjust properly, causing:
- Content overflow
- Panels stuck at fixed sizes
- Poor experience on different screen sizes

**Solution Implemented:**
Panels now **automatically resize** with your browser window!

```
Resize Browser Window
        ↓
Panels Adjust Instantly
        ↓
Perfect Layout Every Time
```

**Technical Details:**
- Added `min-height: 0` and `min-width: 0` to prevent overflow
- CSS Grid uses flexible `1fr` units for equal distribution
- Content areas scroll independently when needed
- Smooth transitions with no performance impact

**Testing It:**
1. Open the Stock Terminal
2. Drag your browser window corner to make it smaller/larger
3. Watch all 4 panels resize proportionally
4. Try extreme sizes - panels stay functional!

### 2. ⛶ Fullscreen Mode

**New Capability:**
You can now **maximize any panel** to use the entire terminal area!

**Why This Matters:**
- **Charts** - See 90 days of price history more clearly
- **Financial Tables** - View 5 years without scrolling
- **SEC Filings** - Read documents comfortably
- **Screener Results** - Compare all 15+ stocks at once

**How to Use:**

#### Method 1: Keyboard (Fastest) ⚡
```
Ctrl+F    → Enter fullscreen for active panel
ESC       → Exit fullscreen mode
```

#### Method 2: Status Bar Button
```
Click "Full ⛶" button in bottom-right corner
```

#### Method 3: Panel Header
```
Click ⛶ icon in any panel header
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- Panel header shows: "⛶ FULLSCREEN" (yellow text)
- Status bar shows: "⛶ FULLSCREEN MODE - Panel X" (yellow text)
- Button changes: "Full ⛶" → "Exit ⛶"
