## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface EconomicEvent {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  time: string;              // "08:30", "16:00"
  title: string;
  type: 'earnings' | 'fed' | 'economic';
  ticker?: string;           // For earnings
  importance: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  description: string;
  estimate?: string;
  previous?: string;
  actual?: string;
}
```

### Calendar Grid Algorithm
```typescript
getDaysInMonth(date: Date): Date[] {
  // 1. Get first day of month
  // 2. Add previous month days to fill first week
  // 3. Add all days of current month
  // 4. Add next month days to fill last week
  // Result: 42 days (6 rows x 7 columns)
}
```

### Countdown Timer
```typescript
calculateCountdown(eventDate, eventTime) {
  const now = new Date();
  const event = new Date(eventDate + " " + eventTime);
  const diff = event - now;
  
  if (diff < 0) return "Past";
  
  days = floor(diff / 86400000);
  hours = floor((diff % 86400000) / 3600000);
  minutes = floor((diff % 3600000) / 60000);
  
  if (days > 0) return `${days}d ${hours}h`;
  if (hours > 0) return `${hours}h ${minutes}m`;
  return `${minutes}m`;
}
```

### Filtering System
```typescript
// Multi-dimensional filtering
filtered = events
  .filter(e => importance === 'all' || e.importance === importance)
  .filter(e => type === 'all' || e.type === type)
  .sort((a, b) => a.date - b.date);
```
